  Care for Pothos (Epipremnum aureum): watering, light, soil, fertilizing, and
  tips.
---
## Tips
- Dust leaves periodically to keep pores clear.
- Use a finger test or moisture meter before watering.
- Adjust watering in winter when growth slows.

## Quick take
Pothos is generally a **easy**-care plant. It tends to thrive in **care** light and appreciates a well-structured potting mix with good drainage.

## Lighting
Aim for **care** light. Avoid extremes unless this plant is known to tolerate them. Gradually acclimate to brighter light to prevent scorch.

## Soil & drainage
Use a **well-draining** potting mix and a container with drainage holes. Consider adding perlite or bark if your mix holds too much water.

## Nutrients
During active growth, apply a balanced, diluted fertilizer on a regular cadence. Ease off feeding in winter.

## Pet Safety
Always confirm pet safety for your specific plant. If in doubt, keep out of reach of curious pets.

## Moisture & watering
Let the top inch of soil dry between waterings. Frequency changes with season, pot size, and light. When in doubt, err slightly on the dry side.
