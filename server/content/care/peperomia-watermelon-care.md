  fertilizing, and tips.

## Watering
Let the top inch of soil dry between waterings. Frequency changes with season, pot size, and light. When in doubt, err slightly on the dry side.

## Helpful notes
- Use a finger test or moisture meter before watering.
- Dust leaves periodically to keep pores clear.
- Ensure the pot has drainage holes.

## Light
Aim for **care** light. Avoid extremes unless this plant is known to tolerate them. Gradually acclimate to brighter light to prevent scorch.

## Safety around pets
Always confirm pet safety for your specific plant. If in doubt, keep out of reach of curious pets.

## Overview
Peperomia Watermelon is generally a **easy**-care plant. It tends to thrive in **care** light and appreciates a well-structured potting mix with good drainage.

## Feeding
During active growth, apply a balanced, diluted fertilizer on a regular cadence. Ease off feeding in winter.

## Growing medium
Use a **well-draining** potting mix and a container with drainage holes. Consider adding perlite or bark if your mix holds too much water.
