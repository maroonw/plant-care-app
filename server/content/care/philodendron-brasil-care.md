## Care tips

## Pet Safety
Always confirm pet safety for your specific plant. If in doubt, keep out of reach of curious pets.

## Sunlight
Aim for **care** light. Avoid extremes unless this plant is known to tolerate them. Gradually acclimate to brighter light to prevent scorch.

## Fertilizer schedule

## Soil & drainage
Use a **well-draining** potting mix and a container with drainage holes. Consider adding perlite or bark if your mix holds too much water.
