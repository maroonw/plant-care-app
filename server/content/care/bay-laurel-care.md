  Care for Bay Laurel (Laurus nobilis): watering, light, soil, fertilizing, and
  tips.
---
## Light
Aim for **care** light. Avoid extremes unless this plant is known to tolerate them. Gradually acclimate to brighter light to prevent scorch.

## Pet-friendliness
Always confirm pet safety for your specific plant. If in doubt, keep out of reach of curious pets.

## Quick take
Bay Laurel is generally a **standard**-care plant. It tends to thrive in **care** light and appreciates a well-structured potting mix with good drainage.

## Soil
Use a **well-draining** potting mix and a container with drainage holes. Consider adding perlite or bark if your mix holds too much water.

## Moisture & watering
Let the top inch of soil dry between waterings. Frequency changes with season, pot size, and light. When in doubt, err slightly on the dry side.

## Care tips
- Adjust watering in winter when growth slows.
- Use a finger test or moisture meter before watering.
- Group plants to increase ambient humidity.

## Feeding
During active growth, apply a balanced, diluted fertilizer on a regular cadence. Ease off feeding in winter.
