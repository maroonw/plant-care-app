## Helpful notes
- Use a finger test or moisture meter before watering.
- Rotate the pot monthly for even growth.
- Adjust watering in winter when growth slows.

## Growing medium
Use a **well-draining** potting mix and a container with drainage holes. Consider adding perlite or bark if your mix holds too much water.
