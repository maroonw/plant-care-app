## Pets & toxicity
Always confirm pet safety for your specific plant. If in doubt, keep out of reach of curious pets.

## Helpful notes
- Rotate the pot monthly for even growth.
- Use a finger test or moisture meter before watering.
- Adjust watering in winter when growth slows.

## Potting mix
Use a **well-draining** potting mix and a container with drainage holes. Consider adding perlite or bark if your mix holds too much water.

Philodendron White Wizard is generally a **hard**-care plant. It tends to thrive in **care** light and appreciates a well-structured potting mix with good drainage.

## Feeding
