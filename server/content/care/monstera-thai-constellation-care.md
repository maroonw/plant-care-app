  Care for Monstera Thai Constellation (Monstera deliciosa 'Thai
  Constellation'): watering, light, soil, fertilizing, and tips.
---
## Fertilizing
During active growth, apply a balanced, diluted fertilizer on a regular cadence. Ease off feeding in winter.

## Watering
Let the top inch of soil dry between waterings. Frequency changes with season, pot size, and light. When in doubt, err slightly on the dry side.

## Growing medium
Use a **well-draining** potting mix and a container with drainage holes. Consider adding perlite or bark if your mix holds too much water.

## Helpful notes
- Dust leaves periodically to keep pores clear.
- Group plants to increase ambient humidity.
- Rotate the pot monthly for even growth.

## Lighting
Aim for **care** light. Avoid extremes unless this plant is known to tolerate them. Gradually acclimate to brighter light to prevent scorch.

## Quick take
Monstera Thai Constellation is generally a **hard**-care plant. It tends to thrive in **care** light and appreciates a well-structured potting mix with good drainage.

## Pet-friendliness
Always confirm pet safety for your specific plant. If in doubt, keep out of reach of curious pets.
