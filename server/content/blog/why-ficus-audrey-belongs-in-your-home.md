**Ficus Audrey** blends style with simplicity, which is why so many plant lovers swear by it.

### What we love
- Works in **plant-spotlight** light.
- Care tier: **hard**.
- Generally moderate watering needs (adjust to conditions).

### Design ideas
Choose a pot that complements its foliage and place it where it gets **plant-spotlight** light.
  
> Pro tip: Dust leaves periodically to keep pores clear.
